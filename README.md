Conflicting Standards
=============
The various best practices, standards, and other materials contain some conflicting information. 

* **camelCase vs. snake_case for JSON keys:** [18f's API standards](https://github.com/18F/api-standards) specify snake (or "underscore") case. [Project Open Data's Common Core Metadata Schema](http://project-open-data.github.io/schema/) specifies camelCase for JSON keys in metadata.
